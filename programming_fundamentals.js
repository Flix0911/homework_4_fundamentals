// DRY
    //Don't Repeat Yourself. Don't do the same thing you just did somewhere in the program
        //Use the tools/functionalities built in that are simplified and can be relied on later

// KISS
    //Keep it simple, stupid. Don't write something overly abstract or solving something in a convuluted manner
        //write something that is to the point, legible to you and others, and that can be clearly understood what it is doing

// Avoid creating a YAGNI
    //You aren't going to need it. Don't create something that you want to add in the future. Create what is current
        //and necessary to what you're going. Everything written should be used in the current moment/set up

// Do the simplest thing that could possibly work
    //Similar to KISS. Simplicity helps you and others who read your work, complex solutions are only adding trouble

// Don't make me think
    //Everything you write should be easy to comprehend by others, straining others to understand your code isn't beneficial at all

// Write code for the maintainer
    //Write with the mindset that someone else is going to maintain this, even if that someone is you, because legibleness and simplicity are easier

// Single responsibility principle
    //Everything written should be doing an excellent job at the one task it is assigned

// Avoid premature optimization
    //Ensure everything works 1st and is doing what you want, worry about efficiency after that

// Separation of concerns
    //Seperate what is accomplishing what into distinct sets/locations in the code.

//Which one surprises you
    //Optimization was an interesting one considering that is how everything thinks, we must always strive to more efficiency

//which one is currently giving you the most struggle
    //A lot of these. I'm repeating myself, not keeping it simple, most likely making teachers/graders think too hard, not everything is doing its job perfectly.
    //I think it will come with time but alas
